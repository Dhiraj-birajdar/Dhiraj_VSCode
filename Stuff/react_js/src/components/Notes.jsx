      <p>
        Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to
        explore outer space.[1] While the exploration of space is carried out
        mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration though
        is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human
        spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is
        one of the main sources for space science.
